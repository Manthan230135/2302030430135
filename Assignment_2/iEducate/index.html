            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional
                framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the
                formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal
                and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary
                education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching
                method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be
                distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education. The term
                "education" can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people and the academic field
                studying educational phenomena.<br><br>The precise definition of education is disputed and there are
                disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from
                indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and
                improve forms of education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching
                cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of
                society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems.
                Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies
                to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International
                organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all
                children.<br></p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3.<br><br>Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early
                childhood education, primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education.
                It varies significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender,
                caste, religion, language, and disability.<br><br>Education in India faces many challenges and
                opportunities, such as improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing
                enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance
                and accountability, promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
                It is influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the
                National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan,
                the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education
                Architecture. It is also supported by various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World
                Bank, civil society organizations, academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.
